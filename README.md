# Emerald Language
## An html5 markup language designed with event driven applications in mind.

## Todo:
- add 'style' rule
- and 'script' rule
- Make prototype v0.1 in ruby with treetop. Use it, get feedback from people on it
  then make version 1.0 with new compiler, completely written in Scala (tokenizer,
  AST, code generator, etc.) [Do the same for sapphire.]
